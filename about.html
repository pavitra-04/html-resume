<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Pavitra Singh, a curious learner with a strong academic foundation and a growing passion for problem-solving, technology, and understanding how things work beneath the surface.
I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into simple, intuitive ideas whether it’s algorithms, object-oriented programming, probability, or organizational behavior. Learning, for me, is not about memorization but about clarity: why something works matters as much as how it works.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve developed a disciplined approach to studying and building skills, balancing analytical thinking with creativity. I value consistency, curiosity, and self-improvement, and I believe growth comes from asking the right questions and staying open to learning every day.</p>

<p>I’m currently focused on strengthening my technical and conceptual skills while preparing myself for opportunities that challenge me to think deeper, work smarter, and grow continuously.</p>
